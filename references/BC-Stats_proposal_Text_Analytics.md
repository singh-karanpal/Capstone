#### Short & snappy project title
Text Analytics: Quantifying the Responses to Open-Ended Survey Questions

#### Organization name
BC Stats

#### About your organization
BC Stats is the provincial government's leader in statistical and economic research, information and analysis. We can help you increase overall business performance by providing the information you need to make effective decisions.

#### Brief description of the problem/question
BC Stats undertakes a number of large-scale surveys on a regular basis. These include:
• Employees of the B.C. public service and other public sector organizations, through various iterations of the Work Environment Survey, which support human resource strategies and planning;
• The post-secondary student outcomes surveys (post-graduation surveys of students who attend B.C. post-secondary institutions), to support decision makers in the Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Training and in the post-secondary institutions, and to support students and potential students in their planning; and
• Public surveys, to support policy areas of government.
These surveys include open-ended questions that provide the respondents an opportunity to express ideas that are not necessarily captured in the quantitative questions.
In the past, these responses have been coded by BC Stats staff or not coded at all. As a consequence, BC Stats has begun exploring solutions that will extract valuable information from the text comments.
Depending on the nature of the data set and what information is available from the survey, there is a possibility of trying structured or unstructured natural language processing techniques (e. g, clustering, topic modeling) in this project.
The development of the R package tidytext and the recent release of the companion book (Silge and Robinson, 2016) presents an opportunity to explore the functionality and utility of text mining these survey responses within the R environment. As BC Stats moves to incorporate R as a tool to support our analytic workflow, we are particularly interested in understanding how this package (and related R functionality) might support our analytic needs.

#### Available data sources
Survey data from various BC Stats surveys (to be determined). One example of these surveys is the BC Public Service Work Environment Survey, which is run every two years. Each cycle of the survey collects responses to ~90 questions, which is combined with demographic characteristics (such as age and job classification), for approximately 20,000 individuals. There is also responses to qualitative questions, which form the basis of text analytic project. The quantitative survey responses are typically stored as SPSS data files, which the text questions would be provided as a CSV text file.

#### Data product
The research project involves using either R and/or Python (R preferred) and associated, relevant text mining packages to prepare analytics of one or more of the open-ended survey questions.
• A model that provides thematic categories of comments
• Code that allows for the extension of the analysis to other institutions and years
• An interactive report or visualization in RStudio or web application such as Shiny

#### Confidentiality restrictions, other legal info
Potential Pitfalls & Risks
{Need for participants to access sensitive personal information will require swearing in as deemed BC Stats employees, under the Statistics Act}
Because of the sensitive personal data, aggregations of data that do not risk revealing confidential information will be required.
British Columbia’s privacy laws constrain and limit the use of cloud services.

#### Potential conflicts of interest?
None

#### Do you have space available for students to work on site?
Potentially

#### Do you anticipate having data scientist job opening(s) after the project?
BC Stats has a number of positions that have been filled by data scientists, including one alumnus of the UBC Master of Data Science program. We will fill vacancies in these positions as they become available, or as new opportunities arise that need data science skills. Other B.C. government departments have data scientists and continue to fill positions requiring data science skills.
