**Q2**: ***Have you seen any improvements in your work environment and if so, what are the improvements?***

<br>


**Theme Identifications**

- Using clustering algorithms like PCA and Topic Modelling

<br>
<br>

**Scalability**

- Descriptive Statistics using Matplotlib, Altair and Plotly with focus on:
  - Identifying trends over the years
  - Identifying trends across Ministries
  
## Deliverables

- Data pipeline with the documentation for our models
- Dash app that displays the trends across ministries for both the qualitative questions

## Estimated Timelines

```{r timeline, include=FALSE}
library(timevis)
data <- data.frame(
  id      = 1:7,
  content = c("Today"  , "Base Model"  ,"Advanced Models","Dashboards","Project Reports", 
               "Project Integration", "Feedback"),
  start   = c("2019-05-08", "2019-05-11", "2019-05-18", "2019-05-20" ,"2019-05-25", "2019-06-01", "2019-06-12"),
  end     = c(NA          , "2019-05-18", "2019-06-01","2019-06-12","2019-06-12", "2019-06-12", "2019-06-17"),
